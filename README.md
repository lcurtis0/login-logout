# login-logout(challenge-14)

# Description

This files are created to complete the Module 14 challenge-14

I want to have an app that has a login that anyone can use and is able to post ideas and create new ones.

This is so that users can save time by sharing ideas and keeping it secure.

I learned the importance grabbing information from a database and being able to display it to frond end.
